Game 2048- Sliding window game
The Game 2048 is a popular and addictive puzzle game that challenges players to combine numbered tiles to reach the elusive tile with the number 2048. The game board consists of a grid with 4x4 cells, and the player can slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, and right) to merge tiles with the same number. With each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 is randomly generated on an empty cell.

The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by strategically merging tiles and creating larger numbers. As the player combines tiles, the numbers on the tiles double, starting from 2 and progressing through 4, 8, 16, and so on. The challenge lies in managing limited space on the board and planning each move to create opportunities for merging tiles.

The game continues until there are no possible moves left on the board, either due to filling up all cells or being unable to merge any adjacent tiles. At the end of the game, the player's score is the sum of all the merged tiles.

This implementation of the Game 2048 offers a user-friendly interface and smooth gameplay. It provides features such as keeping track of the current score, displaying the highest score achieved, allowing the player to undo the last move, and providing an option to restart the game at any time.

Enjoy the addictive puzzle-solving experience of the Game 2048 and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score possible!
